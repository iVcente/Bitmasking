# Bitmasking
A plugin that simplifies bitmasks use in C++ and Blueprints by providing generic functions to most common operations.
The following functions are available:
* `AddFlags()`;
* `RemoveFlags()`;
* `FlipFlags()`;
* `HasAllFlags()`;
* `HasAnyFlags()`.

It's also included an Actor named `Bitmasking_ActorExample` demonstrating how these functions can be used with an Enum and a bitmask variable. More info on Enums can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/danzmann/Enums-53e162396fee4495b4475ee66c22081e?pvs=4).
